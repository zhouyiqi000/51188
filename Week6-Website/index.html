        <h1>Singapore's Public Transport System</h1>

        <p><i>Public Transport Accessibility in Singapore is a data visualisation project that explores how easy it is for residents to access public transport in different neighbourhoods.  
            <br><br> 
            The Story Map combines the locations of MRT and bus stops with 500m and 800m buffers to analyse walkability and public transport coverage in HDB residential areas. It highlights potential transport coverage gaps and assesses the commuting experience to identify areas for improvement.
            <br><br>
            The interactive map allows users to explore accessibility patterns, provide insights, and engage in discussions about fair and efficient public transport planning.
